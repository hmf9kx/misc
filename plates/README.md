Project Description:

  The motivation for this small project stems from a road trip game played with lisence plates. All you need is a license plate with a section with 4 digits. Then the goal is
  to use basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) on the first three digits to reach the last digit, preferably in order. The question was,
  **how many plate combinations were possible using the above rules?** (including preservation of order). As it turns out, 2804 out of the 10000 possible combinations are "valid"
  while the other 7196 can't be reached. In the future, I plan to look at the same question ignoring the preservartion of order and including some more advanced operations such as
  exponentiation, factorializing, etc.
